## Overview

  - Frontend Mentor | Social Proof Section challenge
  - The challenge consisted in replicating social proof section card component for a desktop and mobile view perspective.
  - Here it is two screenshots taken from desktop and mobile perspective;

- My process
  - Built with: HTML + CSS
  - This was not that hard to work on it. However, I knew that, by the size of the card, that I had to think about the responsiveness of the page. So, my approach was to make every width and heigh component as a % value. This got my in some trouble, because some components don't behave well when submitted to a % div. However, after some time trying different components and attributes, I finally could pull the desktop layout off. The mobile perspective was something else.. I would definitely try to start the next project with the mobile view first. Itâ€™s very hard to adapt a layout this big to a mobile version. Thankfully, I opted to a grid approach to make it work. However, It was not easy to figure this out.
